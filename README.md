# Update Lychee photoserver

The bash script allows to update a Lychee photoserver (https://github.com/electerious/Lychee) according to the pictures located in a folder.
Moreover, it uses the Lychee API in order to add description, colors and tags (only for the pictures from the API).
It also removes all the pictures that are not in the folder anymore.

# Additionnal

After a first execution when you are sure the script doesn't take too much time, you can use CRON to automatize the task.
